# IMPORTANT: Fix Cloudflare Pages Build Configuration

## The Problem
Your Cloudflare Pages deployment is NOT building the Hugo site. It's treating your repository as a static file repository instead of a Hugo project that needs to be built.

## The Solution
You need to configure the build settings in your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   - Click on **Pages**
   - Select your project (personal-blog)

2. **Go to Settings → Builds & deployments**
   - Click on **Settings** tab
   - Find **Builds & deployments** section
   - Click **Edit configurations**

3. **Configure Build Settings:**
   
   Set these EXACT values:
   
   - **Framework preset**: `Hugo` (or None if Hugo isn't available)
   - **Build command**: `hugo --minify`
   - **Build output directory**: `public`
   
   Under **Environment variables**, add:
   - Variable name: `HUGO_VERSION`
   - Value: `0.123.7`

4. **Save and Redeploy**
   - Click **Save**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click **Retry deployment** on the latest deployment
   OR
   - Make a small commit to trigger a new build

## Alternative: If Settings Don't Stick

Create a file called `wrangler.toml` in your repository root:

```toml
name = "personal-blog"
compatibility_date = "2023-05-18"

[site]
bucket = "./public"

[build]
command = "hugo --minify"
```

Then commit and push this file.

## Verification
After fixing, your build output should show:
- "Running build command: hugo --minify"
- Hugo build output with page counts
- "Built in XX ms"

Instead of:
- "No build command specified. Skipping build step."

## Current Status
✅ Hugo site structure is correct
✅ .gitignore properly excludes public folder
✅ All content and theme files are in place
❌ Cloudflare Pages is not running the build command

Once you configure the build command in Cloudflare Pages, your site will work correctly!
